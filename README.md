## MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
This project implements a Machine Learning model for spam detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is trained using the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm and TF-IDF vectorization to classify messages as spam or not spam.

## Features

‚úÖ Detects whether a message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**  
‚úÖ Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to preprocess text data  
‚úÖ Implements **Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB)** for classification  
‚úÖ Supports both **terminal-based** and **web-based (Streamlit)** interaction  
‚úÖ Simple and easy-to-use interface  

## 1. Terminal-Based Spam Detection

The model runs in the terminal and supports:

- Detecting spam messages based on trained data
- Taking user input and classifying it as spam or not spam
- Providing real-time predictions

## 2. Streamlit-Based Spam Detection App

The chatbot can also run on a **Streamlit Web Interface**, allowing users to enter text messages and receive classification results instantly.

### Running the Streamlit App

```sh
streamlit run task4.py
```

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Core programming language  
- **Pandas** - Data preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning model (Naive Bayes)  
- **NLTK** - Natural language processing  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** - Feature extraction from text data  
- **Streamlit** - Web-based UI for spam detection  

## Usage

### 1. Terminal-Based Spam Detection:
   - Run `jupyterNotebook_task_4.py` in the terminal.
   - Enter a message to check if it is spam or not.
   - The model will return **"Spam"** or **"Not Spam"** as output.

### 2. Streamlit-Based Spam Detection:
   - Run `task4.py` using `streamlit run task4.py`.
   - Enter a message in the input field.
   - Click **"Validate"** to check if the message is spam or not.
   - The result will be displayed instantly.

## Example Interactions

### **Terminal-Based Prediction:**
```
üì© Spam Detection!!!
üîç Enter your message: Win a free iPhone now!!!
‚úÖ The message is: Spam
```

### **Streamlit-Based Prediction:**
- **User enters:** "Congratulations! You have won a lottery! Click here."
- **ChatBot Response:** ‚úÖ The message is: **Spam**
